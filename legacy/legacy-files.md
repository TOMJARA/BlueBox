# Legacy Simulation Files (Dec 3, 2025)
These were test scripts from initial development chats (role-play crash simulations with NotMyFault.exe). Not for production use in labs.

## Archived Files:
- **BlueBox-CrashGuard.ps1**: BSOD trigger demo (e.g., NotMyFault.exe commands, EULA handling).
- **BlueBox-Installer.ps1**: Fake installer with simulated paths and reboot tests.
- **BlueBox-Recorder.ps1**: Simulated event logger with pretend PDF outputs.

These were fun for safe testing but replaced by the real `BlueBox.ps1` (V1.0) for actual boot-time crash logging.

For history: BlueBox enters IT as Ghass's aircraft-black-box-inspired tool. Contribute to V2!
